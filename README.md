# TripsXplorer
This project uses React, Next.js, and Bootstrap 5 to create a user interface for accessing "Trips" API data. 

Project Overview:

Objective: Build a user-friendly interface for accessing and viewing trip data from the "Trips" API using React and Next.js.

Key Components:

React-Bootstrap Components: You will be using React-Bootstrap (Bootstrap 5) components to create the user interface. This can include elements like navigation bars, cards, buttons, forms, and more.

Trips API Integration: You will integrate the "Trips" API you previously worked on into your React application to fetch and display trip data.

Features and Functionality:

View Trips: Users can access and view a list of available trips.

Trip Details: Clicking on a trip card or item should provide detailed information about that specific trip, including its itinerary, pricing, and other relevant details.

Search and Filters: Implement functionality to allow users to search for specific trips or apply filters to refine their search based on criteria such as destination, date, or price range.

Styling: While you have the freedom to style your app as you wish, you can utilize Bootstrap 5 to ensure a clean and responsive design.

Additional Features: You have the flexibility to add extra features, such as image galleries, user reviews, or interactive maps to enhance the user experience.
